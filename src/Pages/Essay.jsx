      <h1 className="Title">Net/ Web Art</h1>
        <h2 className="Title">A Critical Analysis of "Indirect Flights" by Joe Hamilton (2014)</h2>
        <h3 className="Title">WHAT IS NET/ WEB ART? </h3>

        <p className="P">Net/ web art is a digital art medium that uses intermediality, which means, a collection
of different mediums as a type of “communicative media” for the online world
(Ellestrom, 2021). The internet has become an important influence in society, daily life
as well as relationships (Chatel, 2019), it is powerful tool used to influence and connect
people. Net art refers to art that was created in the 90’s, which included static web
pages and lacked interface. In the 2000’s, specifically after 2006, “post-internet art”
emerged to represent “art after the internet”. The last movement and most current is
the “new aesthetics” which gained popularity after 2012. The new aesthetics
movement was aimed to combine the virtual and physical world (Chatel, 2019).
According to Steve Gibson (2004), technology has become an alternative medium that
has created an opportunity for users to connect with digital environments and
manipulate “multimedia elements” such as sound, movement, and data.</p>

<p className="P">Net art, just like any art movement is used as a tool for self-expression which focuses
on “social and political nature and creates debate” around the current news around
the world (Ricci, 2020). It is a beneficial medium that challenges the current
established norms set in art to facilitate a mode of communication in a more
technologically adept world were creativity of expression is unrestricted.</p>

<h3 className="Title">HOW DOES NET ART TRANSFORM TRADITIONAL ART THROUGH THE
INTERNET? </h3>

<p className="P">The evolution of Net art has opened many revenues for innovation and has
transformed the way art is created and presented. There are 2 main transformations
mentioned in “The Work of Art”, cited by David Carrier (2020) namely, the elimination
of “unique original artworks” that are easily replaced and secondly, the creation and
changes of how visual artworks are crafted. According to Dekker (2018) the “hardware
and software components” play a role in the creative process, aesthetics as well as
the observation of the artwork. This means that Net art has its own uniqueness and
approach to engage with audiences on another level by using traditional art as an
instrument for inspiration.</p>

<p className="P">The advantage of Net art is that a new era of art has emerged along with updated
interpretations of older art. These interpretations are based on the artists experiences
which are intermingled with style and world influence. The disadvantage is the “charm”
that original artworks carry (Carrier, 2020) which are not evident in Net art. Net art
somehow blurs the confines of what is considered art in the traditional paradigm and
what is not. Many traditional artists don’t consider digital art as an art form, however
many suggest otherwise. It is a sensitive argument, since Net art can preserve art and
replicate it in another media that can be protected for future generations. The only
difference is that the product will never have the same characteristics as the original
work. Net art has the ability to transform traditional art through the internet. By
duplicating and reimagining the artwork through different eyes and appreciation, the
user perceives the nature of the artwork in a different way.</p>

<p className="P">Net art may seem like a convenient option compared to art galleries, as art can be
easily accessed with a few clicks, in the comfort of one’s home. This has the ability to
bring the artwork closer to an audience that has not had the opportunity to appreciate
this in the past. Expensive artworks limited to art galleries and heavy security
measures to protect against sabotage and theft, now have expression in someone’s
home without restrictions. This affects how the “art market” (Carrier, 2020) will be
advance, from the storage of artworks to the financing of galleries.</p>

<p className="P">Benedetta Ricci (2020) labels Net art as the “most disruptive art medium” as it does
not have a fixed form but is rather chameleonic as is adapts its visual language
depending on the audience or aesthetic nature. This disruption may be necessary in
an industrialized and technologically advanced world where no borders exist.

<h3 className="Title">INDIRECT FLIGHTS BY JOE HAMILTON (2014) </h3>

<h3 className="Title">ABOUT THE ARTWORK</h3>
<p className="P">“Indirect Flights” was designed by Joe Hamilton in 2014 consisting of photography that
he shot while traveling to Europe, Asia and Middle East (Google Arts and Culture, n.d).
The artwork is an online piece that is made up of print, sculpture and video forms to
create a “layered digital topography” (Google Arts and Culture, n.d), that mimics the
Google maps layout. The zoom-in and zoom-out feature constructs “micro-domains”
(Dekker, 2018) for the user to explore. This feature mimics the Google Maps aesthetics
of interacting with the environment by moving around the artwork. The artwork seems
to loop continuously like a never ending scene which makes user want to experience
the entire artwork.</p>

<p className="P">A range of “raw materials, satellite images, organic textures, brush strokes and
architectural fragments” were included to create the artwork, in other words, mixed
media. This “non-linear approach” (Dekker, 2018) creates depth and a unique
interpretation as compared to traditional topography with a start and end. Again the
“non-linear approach” provides a sense that a user can experience more but at the
same time appreciate every dimension.</p>

<p className="P">The spacial design, colours and mixture of sound devices gives an impression of depth
and navigation as the user moves around the artwork. The layering of imagery and the
colours of each element creates a sense of authenticity of the places that the artist
travelled to. It is an important element in the design as it contributes towards the mood
and emotional state of the user at that point in time. If the design lacked colour, the
mood of the artwork would create a melancholic environment. The use of natural or
rather realistic colours leaves room for the user to interpret the artwork freely.</p>

<p className="P">The sound devices used in the artwork, is another important element that creates a
sense of realism, this technique is also known as a “ hyperreal ” effect (Google Arts and
Culture, n.d). It is made up of footsteps, creaks, electrical static and wind. Sound
devices are known to amplify the user experience and integrate reality with the
experience.</p>

<h3 className="Title">CHALLENGES/ INNOVATION AND TRANSFORMATION COMPARED TO
TRADITIONAL ART.</h3>

<p className="P">Net art is categorized as a “technical media of display” (Bruhn and Schirrmacher,
2021) as the artwork is distributed by mass media, which is the internet. This means
that a larger audience can engage with the artwork as compared to an audience in an
art gallery. This approach encourages more interaction and communication amongst
the digital community. Arguably, the digital community is an ever expanding community
with a strong appreciation for dynamic interactive media.</p>

<p className="P">The main challenge evident in this artwork is familiarity, culture and social norms. What
if the user is not familiar with Europe, Asia or the Middle East? Will the user experience
be compromised or is that what the artist intended? The fragments of information,
being the overlapping photography, “creates documentation of the past” (Dekker,
2018) which is a crucial method to interact with the target audience or user.</p>

<p className="P">Users who have interacted with or are familiar with the places in the artwork will have
a stronger emotional attachment than those who aren’t. They may not appreciate the
artwork as much and therefore have no emotional contact with the artist’s intention.
This is known as “cognitive import” and is defined by a series of signs or symbols that
“produce a mental significance” in the user or audience (Ellestrom, 2021). The use of
cognitive import creates patterns within the artwork for the user to appreciate. These
patterns are the contact point where artist meets user in a mutual space.</p>

<p className="P">The innovation and transformation compared to tradition art is evident in many aspects
such as the use of “digital textures” that are used to create a collage of illusion. The
brushstrokes and variations in photography imitate a traditional collage, whilst the
sound effects add an innovative twist to the artwork. This contributes to the artworks
uniqueness and helps it standout from traditional art collages thus adding a sense of
reality.</p>

<h3 className="Title">HOW DOES IT CREATE MEANING/ EMOTION AND ENGAGE THE AUDIENCE?</h3>

<p className="P">The photos of artifacts, textures and settings, create an emotional attachment to a
place. Each photo layered upon the map can be recognized by an audience specific
to that area. Artifacts, places and even brush strokes (evident in the artwork) tend to
carry history which contributes to the storytelling in the artwork. By using what is known
or familiar to people from that specific area, the artwork compels the audience or user
to network with others that feel the same way. This allows them to connect on a mutual
platform such as the internet. The internet’s purpose, as stated by Gibson (2004), is
to connect users with digital environments, which is evident in Hamilton’s “Indirect
Flights” (2014).</p>

<p className="P">Ellestrom (2021) describes cognitive imports of media as an “extension of the mind”
or rather a transfer of information, which means that the user’s body becomes a media
product. By becoming a media product to an artwork, an emotional attachment is
created between artwork and audience or user. Each translation or experience of the
artwork will differ depending on the audience and their knowledge of current affairs
and experiences which is a dimension intermingled with interpretation.
</p>

<h3 className="Title">CONCLUSION</h3>

<p className="P">In conclusion, Net art is a complex yet powerful medium of expression. One should
however keep in mind that it cannot replace the uniqueness of traditional art, nor can
the norms and standards of traditional art be replaced. Each artform or medium has
its own characteristics, one cannot replace the other, but it can be used to collaborate
with, in order to create an “immersive environment” for people (Gibson, 2004).</p>

<p className="P">Ricci (2020) makes a clear statement that although Net art has opened doors to new
perspectives, it has at the same time ushered new concerns, which challenge the
existing “authorship and authenticity” of the work. The concern comes from technology
constantly being updated which makes older Net art outdated. The complexity of these
challenges will exist as future digital technologies become obsolete or advanced. Net
art, however, is the future and the future is change. With change imminent, art has to
be agile, adaptable and appeal to evolving tastes of the user.
