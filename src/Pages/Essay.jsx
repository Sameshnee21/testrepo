        <h2 className="Title">A Critical Analysis of "Indirect Flights" by Joe Hamilton (2014)</h2>
        <h3 className="Title">WHAT IS NET/ WEB ART? </h3>

        <p className="P">Net/ web art is a digital art medium that uses intermediality, which means, a collection
of different mediums as a type of “communicative media” for the online world
(Ellestrom, 2021). The internet has become an important influence in society, daily life
as well as relationships (Chatel, 2019), it is powerful tool used to influence and connect
people. Net art refers to art that was created in the 90’s, which included static web
pages and lacked interface. In the 2000’s, specifically after 2006, “post-internet art”
emerged to represent “art after the internet”. The last movement and most current is
the “new aesthetics” which gained popularity after 2012. The new aesthetics
movement was aimed to combine the virtual and physical world (Chatel, 2019).
According to Steve Gibson (2004), technology has become an alternative medium that
has created an opportunity for users to connect with digital environments and
manipulate “multimedia elements” such as sound, movement, and data.</p>

<p className="P">Net art, just like any art movement is used as a tool for self-expression which focuses
on “social and political nature and creates debate” around the current news around
the world (Ricci, 2020). It is a beneficial medium that challenges the current
established norms set in art to facilitate a mode of communication in a more
technologically adept world were creativity of expression is unrestricted.</p>

<h3 className="Title">HOW DOES NET ART TRANSFORM TRADITIONAL ART THROUGH THE
INTERNET? </h3>

<p className="P">The evolution of Net art has opened many revenues for innovation and has
transformed the way art is created and presented. There are 2 main transformations
mentioned in “The Work of Art”, cited by David Carrier (2020) namely, the elimination
of “unique original artworks” that are easily replaced and secondly, the creation and
changes of how visual artworks are crafted. According to Dekker (2018) the “hardware
and software components” play a role in the creative process, aesthetics as well as
the observation of the artwork. This means that Net art has its own uniqueness and
approach to engage with audiences on another level by using traditional art as an
instrument for inspiration.</p>

<p className="P">The advantage of Net art is that a new era of art has emerged along with updated
interpretations of older art. These interpretations are based on the artists experiences
which are intermingled with style and world influence. The disadvantage is the “charm”
that original artworks carry (Carrier, 2020) which are not evident in Net art. Net art
somehow blurs the confines of what is considered art in the traditional paradigm and
what is not. Many traditional artists don’t consider digital art as an art form, however
many suggest otherwise. It is a sensitive argument, since Net art can preserve art and
replicate it in another media that can be protected for future generations. The only
difference is that the product will never have the same characteristics as the original
work. Net art has the ability to transform traditional art through the internet. By
duplicating and reimagining the artwork through different eyes and appreciation, the
user perceives the nature of the artwork in a different way.</p>

<p className="P">Net art may seem like a convenient option compared to art galleries, as art can be
easily accessed with a few clicks, in the comfort of one’s home. This has the ability to
bring the artwork closer to an audience that has not had the opportunity to appreciate
this in the past. Expensive artworks limited to art galleries and heavy security
measures to protect against sabotage and theft, now have expression in someone’s
home without restrictions. This affects how the “art market” (Carrier, 2020) will be
advance, from the storage of artworks to the financing of galleries.</p>

<p className="P">Benedetta Ricci (2020) labels Net art as the “most disruptive art medium” as it does
not have a fixed form but is rather chameleonic as is adapts its visual language
depending on the audience or aesthetic nature. This disruption may be necessary in
an industrialized and technologically advanced world where no borders exist.
